Bugs:

- The last point in the graph isn't showing.
  - Apparently the graph is wider than the screen and it doesn't fit
    when there are many data points.


Features:

- Consider using sqlite instead of text file.
- In the table, show the dates.
- Make the table scrollable..
- Put a small verification range.. like more than 60 and less than 80.
- Scale the points to show the relative distance.
- Show today's entered weight if it was there.
  - Ask if user wants to overwrite today's weight.
- Save in external file.
  - This allows for been able to update the app without losing data.
- If there's an error loading the previous weights.. show an error, don't crash.

  - UI:

    - Make it work on landscape mode.
    - Make the table prettier:
      - Add some padding to the table and to the cells.
      - Split space evenly (or maybe even leave more space for the dates).

Etc:

- Fix warning regarding calls to API that require minSdk >= 24.
